excerpt: "The  present  study  aimed  at  investigating,  in  a  longitudinal way, connectedness and syntactic complexity in written narratives in Portuguese (L1) and  English  (L2)  produced  by  5th and 6th  grade  children  enrolled  in  a  bilingual school.  For  the  evaluation  of  connectedness  (thought  organization), we  used the computational tool SpeechGraphs (MOTA et al., 2014, 2016, 2019); syntactic complexity was verified  through  the  analysis  of T-Units  and  the  Subordination Index (HUNT, 1965). Children were asked to write narratives in both languages based on sequences of pictures twice, first in August 2020 and then in August 2021. The  longitudinal  analysis  showed  that  children wrote  more  syntactically complex texts in Portuguese, their L1, in both phases of data collection. In addi-tion, they also wrote more connected narratives (long-range recurrence – LSC) and  more  syntactically  complex  texts  in  Portuguese  in  2021,  in  comparison  to 2020. With respect to their L2, however, no significant growth was perceived in the connectedness or complexity scores, which could also be interpreted as an effect of the pandemic on the development of students’ L2 writing, since children had significantly fewer opportunities to interact in English in online classes, which may have impacted their development of productive skills in their L2.*KEYWORDS*: Bilingualism. Written production. Connectedness. Syntactic com-plexity. Graph analysis."
