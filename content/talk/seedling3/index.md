excerpt: "This study examined the effects of bilingual education and simultaneous biliteracy  on  children’s  levels  of  speech  connectedness  and  reading  in  Portuguese and English. Thirty-two 5th graders completed oral production tasks and took reading fluency and comprehension tests in L1 and L2. Our results  show  that,  in  general,  children  show  connectedness  and  reading  scores  which  are  correlated  in  the  two  languages,  that  is,  the  languages  follow  different,  but  related  paths  in  the  time  point  they  were  assessed.  We conclude that simultaneous biliteracy, in the case of the participants of  this  research,  is  not  detrimental  to  the  outcomes  of  either  language.  On  the  contrary,  it  promotes  the  concomitant  use  of  languages,  which,  in  turn,  seems  to  guarantee  support  for  both  languages,  L1  and  L2,  in  a  bidirectional fashion. *Keywords:*     biliteracy;     bilingual     education;     bilingualism;     speech     connectedness, reading"
