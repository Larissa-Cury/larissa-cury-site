Traditionally, the first thing one has to know when learning a new programming language is how to print **hello, world!**. This expression was first introduced in 1972, in Kernighan's *"The C Programming Language"*. Nowadays, I'd say that printing it is almost an rite of passage to enter the programming world (which leaves us with many fun [memes][3]). You can learn more about its history [here][2]. That being said, this is how I came up with ***Hello, Linguist!***, as a direct reference to ***Hello, World!*** &#128521;

Enough talking! Shall we practice a bit in **R Studio** and **Google Chrome**?!

## R Studio:

> Step 1: type **print("Hello, World!")** <br> 
Step 2: press **CTRL + Enter**

```{r}
print("Hello, World!")
```

> Step 3: **Congrats!**, this is your first code! &#128513;

## Google Chrome:

> Step 1: on a new Google Chrome tab, press **"CTRL + SHIFT + j"**, which will open the "Console":

> Step 2: type: **alert("Hello, world!")** and press **enter**:

> Step 3: **Congrats!** This is your first code! &#128513;

> The ```print()``` function asks RStudio "please, show my string in the 'console'". In this case, our *string* is *Hello, World*. A *string* is a sequence of characters. Using Chrome, ```alert()``` will create an [alert box][1] showing what we've asked to be printed there.

> Be it in RStudio or in Google Chrome, you may use ```print()``` and ```alert()``` to print any string! You may also play with numbers and letters, but be aware that the programs will understand anything that comes inside quotation marks as being part of the *string*. Take a look: 

```{r}
print("My name is Larissa, I was born in 1998!") # letters and numbers
print("Linguistics & stats are fun!") # special characters
print("Hello, linguistic!") # the classic string
```
> **Enjoy it!** <br>

üêï Au-au! Today we learned about the expression *"Hello, world!"*, which is, traditionally, the first line of code of any developer. We learned how to print it using RStudio's ```print()``` function and using Google Chrome's console with ```alert()```. Now you may try to print other strings! See you soon!
