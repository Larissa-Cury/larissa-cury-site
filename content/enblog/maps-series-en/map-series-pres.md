## What can you expect here?

Today is November, 1st of 2022. While scrolling Twitter's feed I came across the **#30DayMapChallenge** and I thought ***"well, why not?!"***. The problem is that I've **never** made a map before using #RStats, so maybe this is a good start!! ðŸŒŽ

You may [check out the challenge here](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge?src=hashtag_click) . Throughout November, each day will have a different [category](https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1576650170535936001). I don't know if I'll be able to plot 30 maps, but ***as Master Yoda once said:***
