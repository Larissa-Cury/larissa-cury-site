# Can you interpret the sum symbol?

I've always find a bit difficult to interpret the sum symbol in Math, but, once you get it, it's not quite difficult! üòä

Basically, you're using the Greek letter "sigma" (in capital letters) to express a sum of *n* values. Take a look at the image below:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="foto0.png" alt="test" width="300" height="300">
</div>

In this picture: <br>

**"n"** represents the last number to be added; <br>
**"i"** represents the index;  <br>
**"1"** represents the first number to be added and <br>
**"X1"** represents the X element at the "iest" position.  <br>


For example, in the equation below, we want to multiply each value from 0 to 3 by 2 and add their results: 
<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="foto2.png" alt="test" width="400" height="400">
</div>

# The Mean 

We can also represent the mean with the sum symbol, such as this: 
<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="foto1.png" alt="test" width="400" height="400">
</div>

In any case, <br>

**"n"** represents the last number to be added; <br>
**"i"** represents the index;  <br>
**"1"** represents the first number to be added and <br>
**"X1"** represents the X element at the "iest" position.  <br>

In order to obtain the mean, we then **divide the sum by "n" elements**! <br> 

üêï In this post, we've learned how to interpret the "sum" symbol and to interpret the mean using this symbol.
