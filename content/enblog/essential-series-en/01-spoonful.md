## What can you expect here? 

Although I've been working with R Studio's for a very short period of time, I recognize that my actual *scripts* are better than the one's I used to write last year and that they're better than the one's I wrote in the beginning of 2022 and better than the ones I wrote last month. In addition to that, I already know that the scripts I'll write next month will be better than the current ones and so on because I'm **ALWAYS** learning.

There is a principle in programming that says ***"Don't repeat yourself - DRY"***. In other words, you should focus on keeping your code as tidy as possible. 

I cannot say that everyone is following (or has followed) the very same path as I am, but I'm trying to follow this principle as hard as I can. I've already noticed that my former codes were extremely (and unnecessarily) long, though I also recognize that they're still not as optimal as I'd want them to be, I know that I'm only able to improve them by learning new functions. 

Actually, this is how I came up with the idea of this whole blog. I needed a place to say ***"OMG, look at this function I've found!"*** instead of writing tones of messages to my only friend who also works with R Studio (*hi, Thales!*)

Enough for now! I've made this series so that I could share some functions which, to my own belief, are **essential** in R Studio. I'm also going to write another series called ***Cool functions in R Studio*** at the same time. I hope that we'll able to learn together and share some knowledge! Any **suggestions are always welcome**, of course! &#128513;
