*Shall we start with notes on Introduction to numbers?*

Differently from the other sections up to now, I've decided to create isolated sections according to the functions' usage. That being said, this page will serve more of a *"guide"* in which I'll later link the accesses to the other pages.

Ps: Notes based on Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy -- **No credits intended**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
```
