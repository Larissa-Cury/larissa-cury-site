## Day2: lines

# Following a SO's post


🐕 Au-au! Today we've made our second map using `ggplot2` in order to complete the *#30DayMapChallenge*. We've found an useful SO post and followed some of its ideas. Today's category was lines, so we've plotted a map to indicate rivers locations around the world. The plot is very simple, but it's a start, right? *Should we say: mission accomplished?!* See you soon!
