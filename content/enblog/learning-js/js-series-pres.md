## What can you expect here?

I've started learning Js quite ago with the amazing Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy. I've came up with this series so that it would be a nice place to have some of my most important notes about the course. 🎇

Js will be important for my career since in Psycholinguistics we constantly deal with programming new experiments. Hence, having the ability of programming them ourselves is not only cool but also an ability that I'm *REALLY* looking forward to getting better every day 🎇

This series will be more of a personal 'cheatsheet', I intend to make the posts very straightforwardly
and handy. 🖐
