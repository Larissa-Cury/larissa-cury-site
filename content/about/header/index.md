<!-- this is a subheadline -->
<p align= "justify">I hold a Summa Cum Laude degree in Linguistics TEST2 the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I also hold a Master's degree in Psycholinguistics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), with an emphasis on the Psycholinguistics of Bilingualism, under the guidance of Professor Ingrid Finger. During my MA, my main research focus was on investigating how Executive Functions were related to the initial reading skills of bilingual children (especially Working Memory).

I fell in love with scientific methodology and Statistics with R. Currently, I'm preparing myself to pursue a PhD somewhere where I can strengthen those skills.

The initial idea of this website was to help fellow colleagues understand a bit more about Stats and programming. I have always been passionate about learning (I've literally just started to learn Python). I hope this portal becomes a great opportunity to share learning experiences! &#128513;

Ps: This whole website was built in R! Isn't that amazing?! ðŸ¤©
