<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a "carioca" (born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and I hold a degree in Languages: Portuguese and English from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. I'm currently taking my Master's degree in Psycholinguistics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (in the South!). I've always been passionate about learning, though I've never thought that one day I'd be diving into the world of Statistics and Programming (but once you start, there's no going back!). I hope this portal becomes a great opportunity to share learning experiences. &#128513;
