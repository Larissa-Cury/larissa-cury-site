<!-- this is a subheadline -->
<p align= "justify">I hold a summa cum laude degree in Languages: Portuguese and English from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I also hold a Master's degree on Psycholinguistics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), with an emphasis on the Psycholinguistics of Bilingualism, under the guidance of Professor Ingrid Finger. 

Nowadays, I am pursuing my phD at the same institution and in the same line of research. My main research focus is on investigating how executive functions are related to the initial reading skills of bilingual children. My biggest research interests concern the interplay between bilingualism and cognition as well as scientific methodology and statistics with R. 


I have always been passionate about learning. I hope this portal becomes a great opportunity to share learning experiences! &#128513; </p>
