<!-- this is a subheadline -->
<p align= "justify"> I am a self-taught data analyst with expertise in R and statistical methods, developed through analyzing undergraduate projects, Masterâ€™s theses, and PhD dissertations.

I have been expanding my expertise towards more industry-related tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. I am looking forward to delivering data-driven insights and solutions in a business context with these tools.

Ps: This whole website was built in R! Isn't that amazing?! ðŸ¤©
